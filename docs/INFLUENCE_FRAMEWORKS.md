# Influence Frameworks

DiploPrepAI integrates established influence and cultural frameworks into diplomatic engagement strategy.

## Cialdini's Principles of Influence

Based on Robert Cialdini's research on persuasion psychology:

### 1. Reciprocity
People feel obligated to return favors.

**Diplomatic application:** Offer something of value first (information sharing, support on their priority issue) to create positive obligation.

### 2. Commitment/Consistency
People want to act consistently with prior commitments.

**Diplomatic application:** Reference previous agreements, joint statements, or public positions to anchor discussions.

### 3. Social Proof
People look to others' behavior for guidance.

**Diplomatic application:** Cite what other G7 partners or allies have done, multilateral consensus, or international norms.

### 4. Authority
People defer to credible experts.

**Diplomatic application:** Leverage technical expertise, institutional knowledge, or senior official endorsement.

### 5. Liking
People are more easily influenced by those they like.

**Diplomatic application:** Build rapport, find common ground, acknowledge counterpart's perspective before presenting asks.

### 6. Scarcity
People value what's rare or time-limited.

**Diplomatic application:** Emphasize unique opportunities, closing windows, or limited availability of partnerships.

## Hofstede Cultural Dimensions

Based on Geert Hofstede's research on cross-cultural communication:

### Power Distance
How a society handles inequality.

| High Power Distance | Low Power Distance |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Hierarchy matters | Egalitarian approach |
| Defer to seniority | Merit-based discussion |
| Formal protocols | Informal acceptable |

### Individualism vs. Collectivism

| Individualist | Collectivist |
|---------------|--------------|
| Personal achievement | Group harmony |
| Direct communication | Face-saving important |
| Quick decisions | Consensus-building |

### Uncertainty Avoidance

| High Uncertainty Avoidance | Low Uncertainty Avoidance |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Detailed agreements | Flexible arrangements |
| Risk-averse | Comfort with ambiguity |
| Formal procedures | Adaptable approach |

### Long-term vs. Short-term Orientation

| Long-term | Short-term |
|-----------|------------|
| Relationship building | Quick results |
| Patience valued | Efficiency prioritized |
| Future-focused | Present-focused |

## Communication Styles

### High-Context vs. Low-Context

| High-Context | Low-Context |
|--------------|-------------|
| Indirect communication | Direct communication |
| Read between lines | Explicit statements |
| Relationship-first | Task-first |
| Non-verbal cues matter | Words carry meaning |

**Examples:**
- High-context: Japan, China, Arab countries, France
- Low-context: Germany, Netherlands, Scandinavia, US

### Application in DiploPrepAI

The system calibrates message framing, directness, and relationship-building emphasis based on counterpart country's cultural profile.

## Framework Integration

DiploPrepAI doesn't apply frameworks mechanically. It uses them as analytical lenses:

1. **Assess** counterpart culture using Hofstede dimensions
2. **Select** influence principle most likely to resonate
3. **Calibrate** communication style (direct/indirect, formal/informal)
4. **Generate** messages that align with cultural expectations
5. **Anticipate** responses based on cultural patterns

Officers should verify these cultural assessments against their direct experience with specific counterparts.
